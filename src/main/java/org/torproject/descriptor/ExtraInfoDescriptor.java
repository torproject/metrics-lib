/**
 * Contains a relay or sanitized bridge extra-info descriptor.
 *
 * <p>Relays publish extra-info descriptors as an addendum to server
 * descriptors ({@link ServerDescriptor}) to report extraneous information
 * to the directory authorities that clients do not need to download in
 * order to function.  This information primarily consists of statistics
 * gathered by the relay about its usage and can take up a lot of
 * descriptor space.  The separation of server descriptors and extra-info
 * descriptors has become less relevant with the introduction of
 * microdescriptors ({@link Microdescriptor}) that are derived from server
 * descriptors by the directory authority and which clients download
 * instead of server descriptors, but it persists.</p>
 *
 * <p>Bridges publish extra-info descriptors to the bridge authority for
 * the same reason, to include statistics about their usage without
 * increasing the directory protocol overhead for bridge clients.  In this
 * case, the separation of server descriptors and extra-info descriptors
 * is slightly more relevant, because there are no microdescriptors for
 * bridges, so that bridge clients still download server descriptors of
 * bridges they're using.  Another reason is that bridges need to include
 * information like details of all the transports they support in their
 * descriptors, and bridge clients using one such transport are not
 * supposed to learn the details of the other transports.</p>
 *
 * <p>It's worth noting that all contents of extra-info descriptors are
 * written and signed by relays and bridges without a third party
 * verifying their correctness.  The (bridge) directory authorities may
 * decide to exclude dishonest servers from the network statuses they
 * produce, but that wouldn't be reflected in extra-info descriptors.</p>
